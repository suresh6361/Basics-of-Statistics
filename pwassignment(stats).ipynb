Understanding dispersion is crucial in statistics because it helps to assess the reliability and consistency of the data. both variance and standard deviation are essential measures of dispersion that help to understand the spread of data. Variance provides a mathematical measure of variability, while standard deviation offers a more interpretable measure in the same units as the data. Together, they help to assess the reliability and consistency of the data, which is crucial for statistical analysis and decision-making.\n",
